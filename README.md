### Input:
A folder contains the following files:
```
MySong.mp3
AnotherTrack.mp3
CoolAudio.mp3

- The tool will not rename files without the `.mp3` extension.

- **No files renamed:** Ensure the folder contains `.mp3` files.
- **Path not found error:** Verify the folder path entered is correct.
- **Permission denied:** Ensure you have write permissions for the folder.
